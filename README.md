👋 Hey there, I'm Snigdha!

Grad student in Computer Science @ UMass Amherst, obsessed with backend systems, distributed data pipelines, and real-time apps.

I like building things that are fast, reliable, and automated — the kind of stuff that turns chaos into order.
Most of my experiments live somewhere between Go, Python, and PostgreSQL, with splashes of gRPC, Redis, React, or Flutter for fun front-end flair.


🧰 My Toolbelt

Languages: Go, Python, TypeScript, SQL
Frameworks: Fiber, FastAPI, React, Next.js
Databases: PostgreSQL, Redis
Cloud & DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Jenkins, Terraform
Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry


🛠️ Things I’ve Built

- Driver Analytics Platform — Ingests ride-hail data in real time, making sense of the chaos with Go and React.

- TradingView-Style Heatmap UI — Zoomable, treemap-based Flutter UI for smooth visualizations.

- Go ↔ Python IPC System — Real-time Unix socket communication using gRPC; yes, it’s fast.

- Elevation-Based Navigation System — Interactive maps with React + Flask, real-time routing, and elevation-aware pathfinding.

- Maruthi Medical Services Internal Tool — Took a fully manual inventory & order tracking workflow and automated it with Go/PostgreSQL, saving hours of weekly work.

(Some of these projects aren’t public yet — consider them my “lab experiments.”)


🌱 Currently Geeking Out On

Real-time data visualization with Flutter + WebSockets

Distributed tracing & observability (Grafana + OpenTelemetry)

Making complex systems a little less intimidating
